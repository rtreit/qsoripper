## Surface-Specific Differences

### F2 - Edit Cell (GUI) vs Toggle Advanced (TUI/Win32)
In TUI and Win32, F2 toggles between the basic and advanced log form views.
The GUI uses F2 for DataGrid cell editing because the advanced form is a
separate overlay (Alt+A). This is an intentional divergence.

### F5/F6 - Refresh/Sync (GUI) vs Advanced Tabs (TUI/Win32)
In TUI and Win32, F5/F6 cycle between advanced form tabs. The GUI uses F5
for grid refresh and F6 for QRZ sync. The QSO card uses Ctrl+Tab and Alt+1..6
for tab switching instead.

### F8 - Callsign Card (GUI) vs Rig Toggle (TUI/Win32)
In TUI and Win32, F8 toggles rig control. The GUI uses F8 for the callsign
lookup card and Ctrl+R for rig control. This gives the GUI a dedicated key
for the frequently-used callsign lookup without losing rig control access.

### Alt+Enter - Inspector (GUI) vs Log QSO (TUI/Win32)
In TUI and Win32, Alt+Enter logs or updates a QSO. The GUI uses Alt+Enter
for the QSO inspector panel and Ctrl+Enter/F10 for logging. This avoids
conflict with the menu access key system where Alt activates the menu bar.

## Discoverability Features

### Contextual Hint Strip (GUI)
The GUI status bar includes a right-aligned contextual hint strip that changes
based on the current focus area:

| Focus Area | Hints Shown |
|---|---|
| QSO Grid | F2 edit · Ctrl+D delete · F8 lookup · Alt+Enter inspect · F5 refresh |
| Logger | Alt+C call · Alt+B band · Alt+M mode · F10 log · Esc clear · Alt+A card |
| Search | Esc clear · Enter search · F3 grid · Ctrl+N logger |

### Inline Shortcut Hints (GUI)
Toolbar buttons show their keyboard shortcuts on the button face.
Examples include "Sort Ctrl+Shift+S", "Cols Ctrl+H", and "Sync F6".
Users do not have to point at a button to find its shortcut.

### Post-Log Focus Return (GUI)
After you log a QSO with F10 or Ctrl+Enter, the GUI clears the form.
It returns focus to the callsign field for the next contact.
This matches the TUI behavior for rapid contest logging.
