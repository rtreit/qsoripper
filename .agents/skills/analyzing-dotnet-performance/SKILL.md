  Scans .NET code for ~50 performance anti-patterns across async, memory,
  strings, collections, LINQ, regex, serialization, and I/O with tiered
  severity classification. Use when analyzing .NET code for optimization
  opportunities, reviewing hot paths, or auditing allocation-heavy patterns.

# .NET Performance Patterns

Scan C#/.NET code for performance anti-patterns and produce prioritized findings with concrete fixes. Patterns sourced from the official .NET performance blog series, distilled to customer-actionable guidance.

Sourced from [dotnet/skills](https://github.com/dotnet/skills) (MIT license).

## When to Use

- Reviewing C#/.NET code for performance optimization opportunities
- Auditing hot paths for allocation-heavy or inefficient patterns
- Systematic scan of a codebase for known anti-patterns before release
- Second-opinion analysis after manual performance review

## When Not to Use

- **Algorithmic complexity analysis** — this skill targets API usage patterns, not algorithm design
- **Code not on a hot path** with no performance requirements — avoid premature optimization

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Source code | Yes | C# files, code blocks, or repository paths to scan |
| Hot-path context | Recommended | Which code paths are performance-critical |
| Target framework | Recommended | .NET version (some patterns require .NET 8+) |
| Scan depth | Optional | `critical-only`, `standard` (default), or `comprehensive` |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Detect Code Signals and Select Topic Recipes

Scan the code for signals that indicate which pattern categories to check.

| Signal in Code | Topic |
|----------------|-------|
| `async`, `await`, `Task`, `ValueTask` | Async patterns |
| `Span<`, `Memory<`, `stackalloc`, `ArrayPool`, `string.Substring`, `.Replace(`, `.ToLower()`, `+=` in loops, `params ` | Memory & strings |
| `Regex`, `[GeneratedRegex]`, `Regex.Match`, `RegexOptions.Compiled` | Regex patterns |
| `Dictionary<`, `List<`, `.ToList()`, `.Where(`, `.Select(`, LINQ methods, `static readonly Dictionary<` | Collections & LINQ |
| `JsonSerializer`, `HttpClient`, `Stream`, `FileStream` | I/O & serialization |

Always check structural patterns (unsealed classes) regardless of signals.

**Scan depth controls scope:**
- `critical-only`: Only critical patterns (deadlocks, >10x regressions)
- `standard` (default): Critical + detected topic patterns
- `comprehensive`: All pattern categories

### Step 2: Scan and Report

**For files under 500 lines, read the entire file first** — you'll spot most patterns faster than running individual grep recipes. Use grep to confirm counts and catch patterns you might miss visually.

For each relevant pattern category, run the detection recipes below. Report exact counts, not estimates.

**Core scan recipes:**
```
# Strings & memory
grep -n '\.IndexOf(\"' FILE                    # Missing StringComparison
grep -n '\.Substring(' FILE                    # Substring allocations
grep -En '\.(StartsWith|EndsWith|Contains)\s*\(' FILE  # Missing StringComparison
grep -n '\.ToLower()\|\.ToUpper()' FILE        # Culture-sensitive + allocation
grep -n '\.Replace(' FILE                      # Chained Replace allocations
grep -n 'params ' FILE                         # params array allocation

# Collections & LINQ
grep -n '\.Select\|\.Where\|\.OrderBy\|\.GroupBy' FILE  # LINQ on hot path
grep -n '\.All\|\.Any' FILE                    # LINQ on string/char
grep -n 'new Dictionary<\|new List<' FILE      # Per-call allocation
grep -n 'static readonly Dictionary<' FILE     # FrozenDictionary candidate

# Regex
grep -n 'RegexOptions.Compiled' FILE           # Compiled regex budget
grep -n 'new Regex(' FILE                      # Per-call regex
grep -n 'GeneratedRegex' FILE                  # Positive: source-gen regex

# Structural
grep -n 'public class \|internal class ' FILE  # Unsealed classes
grep -n 'sealed class' FILE                    # Already sealed
grep -n ': IEquatable' FILE                    # Positive: struct equality
```

**Rules:**
- Run every relevant recipe for the detected pattern categories
- **Emit a scan execution checklist** before classifying findings — list each recipe and the hit count
- A result of **0 hits** is valid and valuable (confirms good practice)

**Verify-the-Inverse Rule:** For absence patterns, always count both sides and report the ratio (e.g., "N of M classes are sealed"). The ratio determines severity — 0/185 is systematic, 12/15 is a consistency fix.

### Step 2b: Cross-File Consistency Check

If an optimized pattern is found in one file, check whether sibling files (same directory, same interface, same base class) use the un-optimized equivalent. Flag as 🟡 Moderate with the optimized file as evidence.

### Step 2c: Compound Allocation Check

After running scan recipes, look for these multi-allocation patterns that single-line recipes miss:

1. **Branched `.Replace()` chains:** Methods that call `.Replace()` across multiple `if/else` branches — report total allocation count across all branches, not just per-line.
2. **Cross-method chaining:** When a public method delegates to another method that itself allocates intermediates, report the total chain cost as one finding.
3. **Compound `+=` with embedded allocating calls:** Lines like `result += $"...{Foo().ToLower()}"` are 2+ allocations — flag the compound cost.
4. **`string.Format` specificity:** Distinguish resource-loaded format strings (not fixable) from compile-time literal format strings (fixable with interpolation).

### Step 3: Classify and Prioritize Findings

Assign each finding a severity:

| Severity | Criteria | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|
| 🔴 **Critical** | Deadlocks, crashes, security vulnerabilities, >10x regression | Must fix |
| 🟡 **Moderate** | 2-10x improvement opportunity, best practice for hot paths | Should fix on hot paths |
| ℹ️ **Info** | Pattern applies but code may not be on a hot path | Consider if profiling shows impact |

**Prioritization rules:**
1. If the user identified hot-path code, elevate all findings in that code to their maximum severity
2. If hot-path context is unknown, report 🔴 Critical findings unconditionally; report 🟡 Moderate findings with a note: _"Impactful if this code is on a hot path"_
3. Never suggest micro-optimizations on code that is clearly not performance-sensitive

**Scale-based severity escalation:**
- 1-10 instances → report at the pattern's base severity
- 11-50 instances → escalate ℹ️ Info patterns to 🟡 Moderate
- 50+ instances → escalate to 🟡 Moderate with elevated priority; flag as codebase-wide systematic issue

### Step 4: Generate Findings

**Keep findings compact.** Each finding is one short block — not an essay. Group by severity (🔴 → 🟡 → ℹ️), not by file.

Format per finding:

```
#### ID. Title (N instances)
**Impact:** one-line impact statement
**Files:** file1.cs:L1, file2.cs:L2, ...
**Fix:** one-line description of the change
**Caveat:** only if non-obvious
```

**Rules for compact output:**
- **No ❌/✅ code blocks** for trivial fixes. A one-line fix description suffices.
- **Only include code blocks** for non-obvious transformations.
- **File locations as inline comma-separated list**, not a table.
- **Merge related findings** that share the same fix.

End with a summary table and disclaimer:

```markdown
| Severity | Count | Top Issue |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| 🔴 Critical | N | ... |
| 🟡 Moderate | N | ... |
| ℹ️ Info | N | ... |

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Correct Approach |
|---------|-----------------|
| Flagging every `Dictionary` as needing `FrozenDictionary` | Only flag if the dictionary is never mutated after construction |
| Suggesting `Span<T>` in async methods | Use `Memory<T>` in async code; `Span<T>` only in sync hot paths |
| Reporting LINQ outside hot paths | Only flag LINQ in identified hot paths or tight loops |
| Suggesting `ConfigureAwait(false)` in app code | Only applicable in library code |
| Recommending `ValueTask` everywhere | Only for hot paths with frequent synchronous completion |
| Suggesting `[GeneratedRegex]` for dynamic patterns | Only flag when the pattern string is a compile-time literal |
| Suggesting `unsafe` code for micro-optimizations | Avoid `unsafe` except where absolutely necessary |
