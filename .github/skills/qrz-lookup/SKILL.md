# QRZ Lookup Skill

## When to Use

- Adding QRZ operator/station lookup features
- Debugging QRZ auth or session token issues
- Mapping QRZ fields into internal station/operator models

## Expectations

1. Keep QRZ logic in integration adapters, not UI layers.
2. Handle auth/session lifecycle explicitly.
3. Use bounded retries and timeouts.
4. Degrade gracefully when QRZ is unavailable.
