//! Alternate in-Rust CW decoder algorithm.
//!
//! Built specifically as a comparison to ditdah's symbol classifier so we
//! can answer the hypothesis: *is the ditdah element classifier itself the
//! bottleneck, or is it the front-end (segmentation, AGC, WPM tracking)?*
//!
//! Pipeline:
//!   1. Estimate dominant pitch (via [`region_stream`]).
//!   2. Compute Goertzel envelope at that pitch over short frames.
//!   3. Hysteresis threshold to produce key-on / key-off events with
//!      durations in seconds.
//!   4. Classify on-durations into dits/dahs using a 1-D split (median or
//!      pin-WPM derived split point).
//!   5. Classify off-durations into intra-character / character / word
//!      gaps using two split points (1.5x and 4.5x dot length).
//!   6. Build morse string and look up in the canonical table.
//!
//! The point is to keep this self-contained: zero coupling to ditdah, no
//! use of the streaming v1 path, and minimal tunable knobs so any
//! regressions are localised.
